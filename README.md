# LLMs-function-calling
building applications with LLMs: function-calling and structured data extraction.

- Learn how you can use function-calling in detail: form prompts with function definitions, and use an LLM response to call those functions.
- Use an LLM with multiple function calls, including parallel and nested function calls. This allows you to create complex agent workflows where an LLM plans and executes a series of function calls to achieve a goal.
- Use OpenAPI specifications to build function calls that can access web services.
- Use function-calling to extract structured data from a natural language input.
- Build an application that takes customer service transcripts, builds SQL calls, and stores results in a database with commands generated by the LLM.
